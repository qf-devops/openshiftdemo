Common OpenShift Upgrade Issues

1. Cluster Operators Stuck in Progressing/Degraded
* Cause: Custom configurations or unsupported versions of CRDs/operators blocking upgrade.
* Solution:
    * Run oc get co and inspect any stuck operator with oc describe co <operator>.
    * Check logs for operators: oc logs -n openshift-<component> deploy/<pod-name>
    * Reconcile any changes you’ve made to the operator’s configuration.

2. Node Upgrade Fails / Node Stuck in Draining
* Cause: Pods with PodDisruptionBudget, misconfigured daemonsets, or non-evictable pods.
* Solution:
    * Check which pod is blocking the drain: oc adm drain <node> --dry-run
    * Temporarily remove or relax PDBs, use --force only with caution.

3. Machine Config Operator (MCO) Issues
* Cause: Incompatible custom MachineConfigs or ignition templates.
* Solution:
    * Run: oc get mcp (MachineConfigPools)
    * Check MCO logs: oc logs -n openshift-machine-config-operator <pod>
    * Remove or fix problematic custom MachineConfigs (e.g., invalid file paths, incorrect permissions).

4. Unsupported APIs or Deprecated Resources
* Cause: Using deprecated APIs (like extensions/v1beta1) that were removed in newer versions.
* Solution:
    * Run oc get apirequestcounts to identify deprecated APIs being used.
    * Refactor manifests or Helm charts to use the supported API versions.

 5. Custom Resources (CRs) Breaking Operator Lifecycle
* Cause: Custom CRs may not conform to new schema/validation in upgraded operator versions.
* Solution:
    * Review CRDs and CRs before upgrade.
    * Backup and validate with operator version compatibility guides.

 6. Upgrade Freezes During Pre-Checks
* Cause: Cluster version operator (CVO) validations failing.
* Solution:
    * Run: oc adm upgrade
    * Look at oc get clusterversion and oc describe clusterversion for validation errors.
    * Fix issues like invalid image sources, missing channels, or incompatible versions.

 7. Persistent Volume Attach Failures Post Upgrade
* Cause: CSI driver versions incompatible or PVCs not migrated properly.
* Solution:
    * Check CSI controller pods and logs.
    * Make sure all storage operators are updated.
    * If CSI migration is needed (e.g., from in-tree to CSI), follow Red Hat migration documentation.

 8. Custom Network Configurations Failing
* Cause: Unsupported changes to CNI plugins or MTU sizes not compatible post-upgrade.
* Solution:
    * Check oc get network.operator cluster -o yaml for network settings.
    * Validate MTU, VXLAN/OVN configurations.
    * Restart affected pods or nodes if needed.

 9. Authentication and OAuth Failures
* Cause: Custom identity providers or RBAC changes breaking new OAuth flows.
* Solution:
    * Validate IDP settings post-upgrade.
    * Check oauth logs: oc logs -n openshift-authentication
    * Recreate secrets/certificates if expired or mismatched.

 10. Cluster Monitoring Broken
* Cause: Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Alertmanager, etc.) misconfigured or version mismatched.
* Solution:
    * Check status: oc get pod -n openshift-monitoring
    * Validate ClusterMonitoringConfig is still compatible.
    * Restart the monitoring stack if required.
